# Personal Commitments

Please initial each commitment and sign at the bottom indicating you
agree to the following:

1. **Safety.** I will take care of myself, my privacy and my safety during
this course. I know that I can [pass](../protocols/pass.md) on anything and [check out](../protocols/checkout.md) at
will, with no penalties attached.
**(Initials ________)**

2. **Staff.** I want to learn about myself, about team dynamics, about
my teammates, and I want to understand what the course staff
understands about teams. For the duration of the course, I will
suspend disbelief and adopt as a learning strategy the pretense that
presented ideas are true. I want to learn efficiently and I am willing
to accept the staffâ€™s guidance to find new efficiency in my learning.
I will refrain from providing feedback during the course.
**(Initials ________)**

3. **The Core Culture.** I have read [The Core Commitments](../corecommitments.md) and
[protocols](../README.md) to be used in the course. I agree to adhere to The Core
commitments and protocols during the course. This includes
requiring that others on my team adhere to The Core protocols and
commitments.
**(Initials ________)**

4. **Durability.** If any of the above (1-3) commitments are untrue of
me now or become untrue sometime during the course, I will
resolve this with the staff immediately.
**(Initials ________)**
