# Web of Commitment Express
NOTE: Sincerity, depth, passion and vulnerability are essential. The more of each from all, the greater the team’s ultimate results will be.
  
1. Create a ritual space.
2. Team proceeds in silence into the ritual space.
3. Each member of the team, in turn, as desired:

    a. Says: “I want alignment virtue.”
    
    b. Offers: From the heart, any key sentiments/thoughts/feelings describing the [Alignment](../protocols/personalalignment.md) choice.

    c. [Asks for Help](../protocols/askforhelp.md):

    Ask each teammate, one at a time:

    “When I signal, will you response.”  
    AND/OR  
    Asks for help anticipated in the future with respect to alignment.
  
    d. When each team member has done a-c, and all team members have closure on all help requests, The Web of Commitment is in place.
  
4. To exercise the Web, each team member accepts the following assignment:

    At least one time during the course, or after, but while still with some teammates, or even in email after that, you will inform the team you are working on your [Alignment](../protocols/personalalignment.md) by saying your signal.
