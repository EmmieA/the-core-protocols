# Meet

## Purpose
Use when one or more people meet to accomplish something.

## Steps
1. [Check In](../protocols/checkin.md).
2. State What You Want.
    State, in a succinct way, what you want to get from this meeting.

    Examples:
    * “I want to know what our message is for this version.”
    * “I want ideas for how to improve morale on this team.”
    * “I want to [Perfection Game](../protocols/perfectiongame.md) how that last customer meeting went.”
    * If you want what someone else wants in the meeting, you may state that as your Meeting Alignment. Example: “I want the same thing that Joe wants.”

3. Alignment Check.

    At any point during the meeting, especially when a lull occurs or someone is off topic, say “Alignment Check.” At that point each person states, from 1 to 10, where he or she is in getting what he or she wants. Whoever has the lowest score is expected to lead in attaining what he wants. If you give yourself a 10 during an Alignment Check, this means you have gotten what you wanted and may leave the meeting if desired.
    
    1. State a new Want.
    2. If you have agreed to help someone get what they want, then you would stay until they have gotten their want.
    3. [Check Out](../protocols/checkout.md)
    
    Examples:
    1. “Alignment Check”
    2. “9”
    3. “2”
    4. “10”
    5. “8”
    6. “Sue, you said 2, so let’s work on yours.”
    
4. Adding Wants (Optional).

    If you are at a 10 in getting what you wanted, you may add a new Want.
    
    Example:
    
    “I want to add a new Want. I want to give the team my idea about how to ship this product earlier.”
    
    At that point, proceed to get the new Want until you are at a 10.

5. [Check Out](../protocols/checkout.md).

    After getting what you want out of the meeting, you may do one of the following:
    * State a new Want.
    * If you have agreed to help someone get what they want, then you would stay until they have gotten their want.
    * [Check Out](../protocols/checkout.md)

## Commitments
* To have a measurable, desired personal outcome for the meeting.
* To get what you say you want from the meeting.
* To hold others accountable for getting what they want.
* To declare and pursue only one Want at a time.
* To re-perform Meeting Alignment when your Want changes during a meeting or if you have a new Want after achieving your previous one.
* To have a relevant Want that is in line with the overall meeting objectives.
* To leave the meeting if you do not know what you want.
* To support others in leaving the meeting when they have what they want (are at a 10).

## Notes
* State any meeting constraints at the beginning of the meeting.
* Split into smaller groups if there are more than 8 participants in a meeting.
* Use [Decider](../protocols/decider.md) to make decisions efficiently.
* [Ask for Help](../protocols/askforhelp.md) to get what you want.

    Example: “Dave, will you help me after this meeting by going over this with me?”

* Take explicit action to pursue what you want from the meeting if you are the lowest on an Alignment Check.
* Do an [Intention Check](../protocols/intentioncheck.md) on why you are in the meeting, especially if you don’t know what you want.
* Limit discussions when results do not come quickly. If needed, simply make a presentation and ask for ideas, perfecting, and 1-1 discussions once the meeting is over.
