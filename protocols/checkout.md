# Check Out
Check Out requires that your physical presence always signifies your engagement. You must check out when you are aware that you cannot maintain the [Core Commitments](../corecommitments.md) or whenever it would be better for you to be elsewhere.

## Steps
1. Say “I’m checking out.”
2. Physically leave the group until you’re ready to [check in](checkin.md) once again.
3. Optionally, if it is known and relevant, you can say when you believe you’ll return.
4. Those who are present for the check-out may not follow the person, talk to or about the person
checking out, or otherwise chase him or her.

## Commitments
* Return as soon as you can and are able to keep the [Core Commitments](../corecommitments.md).
* Return and [check in](checkin.md) without unduly calling attention to your return.
* Do not judge, shame, hassle, interrogate, or punish anyone who checks out.

## Notes
* When you check out, do it as calmly and gracefully as possible so as to cause minimal disruption to others.
* Check out if your emotional state is hindering your success, if your receptivity to new information is too low, or if you do not know what you want.
* Checking out is an admission that you are unable to contribute at the present time.
